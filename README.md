## Octant Plugin Samples

This repository contains minimal code samples illustrating some common patterns around plugins.

Supported plugins are written in TypeScript or Go, although it is possible to write plugins in any language.

Each plugin sample should contain:

- A description of what the plugin does
- A demo of the use case
- Notes and caveats about the usage pattern, if any
- Installation instructions

## Prerequisites

Plugins written in Go will require Golang 1.16 or above. Plugins written in TypeScript will require an installation of Node and NPM.

Using the latest version of Octant is also recommended.

 - Go version 1.16+
 - Node 14+
 - Octant 0.23+

## Samples

| Sample | Go | TypeScript | Description |
| ----- | --- | ----- | ----- |
